	   </h3>
	   <hr>


		 <p>
		   This is <b>Hepadnavirus-GLUE</b>, a GLUE
		   project supporting comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis of
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://viralzone.expasy.org/9">hepadnaviruses</a>
		   (family <i>Hepadnaviridae</i>). 
		  
		 </p>
	   

		 <p>
		   Hepadnaviruses (<a target="_blank" href ="https://viralzone.expasy.org/9?outline=all_by_species">
		   family <i>Hepadnaviridae</i></a>) are reverse-transcribing DNA viruses that
		   infect vertebrates. The type species - <b>hepatitis B virus (HBV)</b> - is estimated to
		   infect ~300 million people worldwide, causing substantial morbidity and mortality.
		   Recent studies have revealed that hepadnaviruses infect a diverse range of
		   vertebrate species, ranging from fish to mammals. They are associated with
		   disease in many of these species.

		 <p>
		   Since the emergence of the SARS-COV2 pandemic, many have become familiar with 
		   the use of <b>virus genome data</b>  to track the spread and evolution of pathogenic viruses
		   - e.g. via tools such as <a target="_blank" href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/global""><b>NextStrain</b></a>. 
		   However, it is less widely appreciated that the same kinds of data sets and comparative genomic approaches
		   can also be used to explore the structural and functional basis of virus adaptations. 
		 </p>

		 <p>	   
		   The 
		   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools"><b>GLUE software framework</b></a>
		   provides an extensible platform for implementing computational genomic
		   analysis of viruses in an <b>efficient, standardised and reproducible</b> way.
		   <b>GLUE projects</b> can not only incorporate all of the data items typically used in
		   comparative genomic analysis
		   (e.g. sequences, alignments, genome feature annotations) but can also represent the complex
		   semantic links between these data items via a <b>relational database</b>.
		   This 'poises' sequences and associated data for application in computational
		   analysis, minimising the requirement for labour-intensive pre-processing of datasets.
		 </p>

		 <p>
		   GLUE projects are equally suited for carrying out exploratory work 
		   (e.g. using virus genome data to investigate structural and functional properties of viruses)
		   as they are for implementing operational procedures (e.g. producing
		   <a target="_blank" href="http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/exampleReports/resistanceGeno1.html?hcvGlueVersion=0.1.68""><b>standardised reports</b></a>
		   in a public or animal health setting).
		 </p>      

		 <p>
			Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control system (e.g. <b>GitHub</b>) provides
			a mechanism for their stable, collaborative development, as shown below.

	   <a id="WhyGlueProject" class="anchor" href="#glueProject" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>What does building the Hepadnavirus-GLUE project offer?</strong>
	   </h3>
	   <hr>

		 
 
		 <p>
		 
			Hepadnavirus-GLUE offers a number of advantages for performing comparative sequence
			analysis of hepadnaviruses:

		   <ol>

			 <li> <strong>Reproducibility</strong>. 
			 For many reasons, bioinformatics analyses are notoriously difficult to reproduce.
			 The GLUE framework supports the implementation of fully reproducible 
			 comparative genomics through the introduction of data standards and the use 
			 of a relational database to capture the semantic links between data items.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Reusable data objects and analysis logic</strong>. 
			 For many - if not most - comparative genomic analyses, data preparation is nine
			 tenths of the battle. The GLUE framework has been designed to ensure that 
			 work spent preparing high-value data items such as multiple sequence alignments
			 need only be performed once. Hosting of GLUE projects in an online version control 
			 system such as GitHub allows for collaborative management of important data items
			 and community testing of hypotheses.
			 </li>
			 <br>


			 <li> <strong>Validation</strong>. 
			 Building GLUE projects entails mapping the semantic links between data items
			 (e.g. sequences, tabular data, multiple sequence alignments).
			 This process provides an opportunity 
			 for cross-validation, and thereby enforces a high level of data integrity.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		 
			 <li> <strong>Standardisation of the genomic co-ordinate space</strong>. GLUE
			 projects allow all sequences to utilise the coordinate space of a chosen 
			 reference sequence. Contingencies associated with insertions and deletions
			 (indels) are handled in a systematic way.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Predefined, fully annotated reference sequences</strong>:
			 This project includes fully-annotated reference sequences for major lineages
			 within the <i>Hepadnaviridae</i> family.
			 </li>
			 <br>
		   
			 <li> <strong>Alignment trees</strong>:
			 GLUE allows linking of alignments constructed at distinct taxonomic levels
			 via an 
			 "<a target="_blank" href="./website/html/alignmenttree.html"><b>alignment tree</b></a>"
			 data structure. In the alignment tree, each alignment
			 is constrained to a standard reference sequence, thus all multiple sequence
			 alignments are linked to one another via a standardised coordinate system.
			 </li>
			 
		   </ol>

		 </p>

         <br>
         


         <br>
         
		 <p>
		
				
		   <b>There are a wide variety of ways in which the Hepadnavirus-GLUE resource can be used</b>:
		   
		   <ul>
		 
			 <li> To perform comparative genomic studies across the family <i>Hepadnaviridae</i>,
			 e.g. as part of an investigation of hepadnavirus diversity.
			 </li>
		   
			 <br>
		 
			 <li> To facilitate in-depth comparative investigations of any virus species or group
			 within the family <i>Hepadnaviridae</i>.
			 </li>
		   
			 <br>

			 <b>NOTE: For those specifically interested in <b>hepatitis B virus (HBV)</b>, we suggest to investigate
			 our separate
			 <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/HBV-GLUE">HBV-GLUE</a> resource.</b>
 
			 <br>

	   </h3>
       <hr>


		   
		 <p>
	
		   On computers with <a href="http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/installation">GLUE installed</a>,
		   the <b>Hepadnavirus-GLUE</b> project can be instantiated by navigating to the project folder,
		   initiating GLUE, and issuing the following command in the GLUE shell:
         
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /
  GLUE> run file buildCoreProject.glue</code></pre>
		 
		 </p>

        This will build the Hepadnavirus-GLUE core project by executing the commands in
		 <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Hepadnaviridae-GLUE/blob/master/buildHepadnaviridaeCoreProject.glue"><b>this file</b></a>.
		 
	   </p>


	   <p>
		 The <i>Hepadnavirus-GLUE</i> project can be further extended to incorporate
		 EVE sequences by executing the commands in
		 <a href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Hepadnaviridae-GLUE/blob/master/buildHepadnaviridaePaleoProject.glue"><b>this file</b></a>,
		 as follows.
         
  <pre>
  <code>Mode path: /
  GLUE> run file buildPaleoProject.glue</code></pre>
		 		  
	   </p>

	   <p>
		 The <b>paleovirus</b> extension of incorporates a set of endogenous
		 viral elements (EVEs) recovered from the genomes of metazoan species. Building
		 the paleovirus extension allows automated alignment and phylogeny reconstruction
		 for individual eHBV lineages in the project, based on the classifications in
		 <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Hepadnaviridae-GLUE/blob/master/tabular/eve/"><b>these files</b></a>.
		 Individual eHBV sequences have been classified into sets considered likely to 
		 have arisen from the same germline colonisation event. Loci have been named using
		 a systematic approach (see 
		 <a href="./website/paleoviruses.html"><b>here</b></a> for details).
